## Welcome to the Future of Interactive Presentations

In this demonstration, we showcase cutting-edge technology that brings interactive coding directly into slide decks using WebAssembly (WASM) through the new official Quarto WebAssembly backend: [`quarto-live`](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/) by George Stagg. This innovative approach revolutionizes how we present and teach programming concepts by allowing for real-time code execution, visualization, and exercises within the presentation itself.

You can view the demonstration here:

For more on the Quarto WebAssembly backend, see the [official documentation](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/).

## What's Inside

This demonstration includes a Linear Regression overview that uses both R and Python code snippets to illustrate the concepts. You can interact with the code blocks, modify them, and see the results instantly. We've also included a built-in timer on the exercise
page to provide a stoppage time for the exercise.

## The Power of WebAssembly in Presentations

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, designed as a portable target for high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust. By leveraging WebAssembly:

- We can run R and Python code directly in the browser.
- Presentations become interactive, allowing audience members to modify and run code in real-time.
- Complex computations and visualizations can be performed client-side, reducing server load and improving responsiveness.

## How It Works

1. **R Integration**: We use [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/), an R distribution compiled to WebAssembly, to run R code in the browser.
2. **Python Integration**: [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), a Python distribution for the browser, is used to execute Python code.
3. **Quarto + RevealJS**: The presentation is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/), providing a smooth, web-based slide experience.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Engagement**: Audience members can experiment with code in real-time, fostering active learning.
- **Flexibility**: Presenters can easily modify examples on the fly to answer questions or explore different scenarios.
- **Accessibility**: No need for local installations; everything runs in the browser.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures everyone sees the same results, regardless of their local setup.

## Getting Started

To explore this demo:

1. Navigate through the links above to view each component.
2. In the slide decks and tutorials, look for interactive code blocks where you can modify and run code.
3. Experiment with different inputs and see how the outputs change in real-time.

## Technical Requirements

### For Viewers and Presenters

- A modern web browser with WebAssembly support (most up-to-date browsers support this).
- For the best experience, use a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device.

### Authoring

To create interactive presentations like this, you'll need to use Quarto with the `quarto-live` backend. Please make sure you have at least Quarto v1.4.0 or later installed. You may need to install additional packages for R and Python support.
